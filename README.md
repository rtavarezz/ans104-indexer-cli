Goal

Build an ANS-104 indexer CLI for the Arweave network in Rust.

The CLI should allow you to pass in an ANS-104 bundle transaction ID, index it and dump a parsed array to a file. Bundles use the ANS-104 specification.

Research/TODOs:

- research about Arweave network and look into ANS-104 spec.
- build a mock cli first to try rust cli parsing libraries and solidify cli knowledge.
